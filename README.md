# Lightweight-Security-Data-Streaming-Based-on-Reconfigurable-Logic-for-FPGA-Platform

In this repo, a novel lightweight, security data streaming system, based on reconfigurable logic, is proposed. The introduced system (Reconfigurable) is designed to operate in three different modes, each efficiently operating as one alternative cipher data streaming. The proposed system utilizes certain common attributes, found between those three stream ciphering modes of operation. It aims at a minimized demand of allocated resources. In addition, it is targeted to maintain the security level, provided by all three of them, on the same FPGA platform. Furthermore, a Conventional System is also introduced, in order to have a fair and detailed comparison, with the proposed system. The Conventional consists of the same three stream data ciphering modes mentioned above, implemented on the same hardware platform, as separate ciphering cores. The three data stream ciphering modes, that both the Reconfigurable and the Conventional systems integrate are: SOBER-128, SNOW 2.0, and TURING. Each one of the them is fully implemented, according to the official specifications.
